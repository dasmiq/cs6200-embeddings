# CS6200 / IS4200: Embeddings

After cloning this repository, you can edit the Jupyter notebook locally or an a hosted platform like Google Colab. Read through the notebooks `embeddings.ipynb`, filling in code and explanations in the blocks starting with "TODO". Note that `embeddings.ipynb` has some extra credit questions at the end.

Whenever you'd like to save your work, and when you are done, make sure to check in and push to GitHub (if working locally) or, in Colab, select "Save to GitHub", formerly in the File menu, now to the right of it.
